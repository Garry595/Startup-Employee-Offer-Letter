This form is designed to be used by the Company for rank-and-file employees. Generally a full-blown Employment Agreement (below) would only be appropriate for the CEO and certain key executive officers of the Company. Everyone else would typically sign this much shorter and simpler form of Offer Letter. Make sure you get advice from counsel before using this form for the first time so that your counsel can warn you about the usual pitfalls for start-ups such as failing to pay attention to minimum wage requirements.

This legal document comes from the Start-Up Forms Library provided by Orrick's Emerging Companies Group. Orrick is an international law firm with headquarters in San Francisco and over 1,100 lawyers worldwide in 21 offices.
